<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It encompasses a wide range of technologies that enable systems to perceive, reason, act, and adapt to their environment. AI is not a single entity, but rather a collection of technologies working together to achieve human-like intelligence</p>
